🎀 Pixel Punch: The "What, Like It's Hard?" Habit Tracker<br><br>
💅 The Vision<br>
Why track habits in a boring spreadsheet when you could do it with style? Pixel Punch is a habit tracker built for those who are over-prepared, under-estimated, and obsessed with aesthetic progress. It combines the tactile satisfaction of a physical punchcard with a lo-fi pixel art interface.<br><br>

"Exercise gives you endorphins. Endorphins make you happy. Happy people just don't shoot their husbands, they just... finish their habit streaks."<br><br>

✨ Features<br>

The "Delta Nu" Punchcard: Visual feedback that turns every completed task into a satisfying pixel "punch."<br><br>

Optimism-Driven Logic: Built using Gemini to provide encouraging (and slightly sassy) feedback on your streaks.<br><br>
